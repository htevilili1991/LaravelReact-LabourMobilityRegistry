# LabourMobilityRegistry (Laravel + React.js)

This project is a reimplementation of the [LabourMobilityRegistry](https://github.com/htevilili1991/LabourMobilityRegistry), originally built in R Shiny, now developed using **Laravel** for the backend and **React.js** for the frontend. The goal is to enhance the application's performance, scalability, and maintainability while retaining its core functionality as a labor mobility tracking and management system.

## Why Switch to Laravel + React.js?

The transition from R Shiny to Laravel + React.js was driven by the following reasons:

1. **Improved Scalability**: Laravel's robust PHP framework and React.js's efficient rendering enable the application to handle larger datasets and more concurrent users compared to R Shiny's limitations in high-traffic scenarios.
2. **Enhanced User Interface**: React.js provides a dynamic, component-based frontend, delivering a smoother and more interactive user experience than R Shiny's UI capabilities.
3. **Better Maintainability**: Laravel's MVC architecture and React.js's modular components make the codebase easier to maintain, extend, and debug compared to R Shiny's monolithic structure.
4. **Wider Developer Ecosystem**: Laravel and React.js have larger, more active communities, providing access to extensive libraries, tools, and developer expertise, which facilitates faster development and issue resolution.
5. **Improved Performance**: The combination of Laravel's optimized backend processing and React.js's virtual DOM ensures faster load times and more efficient client-side rendering.
6. **Robust API Integration**: Laravel's built-in support for RESTful APIs pairs seamlessly with React.js, enabling better integration with external services and future-proofing the application.
7. **Cost-Effective Deployment**: Laravel's compatibility with a wide range of hosting platforms and React.js's static build capabilities reduce deployment costs compared to R Shiny's specialized server requirements.
